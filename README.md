## Introduction

The AI Resume Analyzer began as a personal experiment to explore how AI can evaluate resumes similar to real Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
The goal was to create a simple, private, and completely serverless tool. Using Puter.js, everything runs in the browser no backend needed.

This web app allows users to upload their resumes, receive instant AI-based scores, and get constructive feedback for improvement.
It’s a modern example of how AI and frontend technologies can come together to build practical, real-world tools.
